## REQUIREMENT

# Autonomous Topology Self-Healing

## Metadata
- **Category**: performance
- **Effort**: Unknown (8/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (10/3)
- **Scan Type**: moonshot_architect
- **Generated**: 3/1/2026, 4:26:08 PM

## Description
Implement a real-time monitor that detects "dead-letter" events and broken trigger chains. The system autonomously identifies alternative agents with similar capabilities and re-routes events to maintain workflow continuity without human intervention.

## Reasoning
Production pipelines often fail due to minor credential issues or service outages. Self-healing topologies ensure 99.9% uptime for AI agents, moving them from "cool tools" to "mission-critical infrastructure."

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Triggers & Event Routing

**Description**: Define event triggers that automatically activate agents. Configure trigger conditions, build event flows with visual diagrams, manage event subscriptions, and route events between agents in the system.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
