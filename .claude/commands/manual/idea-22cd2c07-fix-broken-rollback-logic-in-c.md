## REQUIREMENT

# Fix broken rollback logic in CredentialSchemaForm

## Metadata
- **Category**: code_quality
- **Effort**: High (3/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (7/3)
- **Scan Type**: bug_hunter

## Description
The 'createCredential' store action in 'credentialSlice.ts' catches its own errors and returns 'undefined'. 'CredentialSchemaForm.handleSave' expects it to throw to trigger a rollback of the orphaned 'ConnectorDefinition'. This results in leaked connector definitions when credential creation fails.

## Reasoning
When saving a new credential, the system first creates a connector and then the credential. If the credential fails, the connector must be deleted to avoid a broken UI state. The current error-swallowing pattern in the store action makes this cleanup impossible.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Credential Management

**Description**: Store, edit, and organize API credentials and secrets. Browse credentials in a list or picker, view card details with health checks, manage rotation policies, and connect credentials to specific connector types with schema-driven forms.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
