## REQUIREMENT

# Preserve catalog search text on CANCEL_FORM navigation

## Metadata
- **Category**: code_quality
- **Effort**: Medium (2/3)

## Description
In useCredentialViewFSM.ts, the CANCEL_FORM action resets the catalog-browse view to search: empty string when navigating back from catalog-form or catalog-auto-setup. If the user searched for github in the catalog, selected a connector, then cancelled the form, they return to the full unfiltered catalog losing their search context. Change the CANCEL_FORM reducer case to preserve the search text: store the search term in the catalog-form and catalog-auto-setup states (add a parentSearch field to these state variants), then restore it on CANCEL_FORM: return { view: catalog-browse, search: state.parentSearch or empty }. The GO_CATALOG_FORM action should copy the current search into the new state.

## Reasoning
Losing search context on navigation is a frustrating UX pattern that makes users repeat work. In the credential vault, users often search for a specific service, browse several options, open the form for one, then cancel and try another. Resetting the search each time forces them to retype the same query. The fix is minimal (adding one field to two FSM state variants and reading it back on CANCEL_FORM) and aligns with the existing FSM architecture.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Credential Management

**Description**: Store, edit, and organize API credentials and secrets. Browse credentials in a list or picker, view card details with health checks, manage rotation policies, and connect credentials to specific connector types with schema-driven forms.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
