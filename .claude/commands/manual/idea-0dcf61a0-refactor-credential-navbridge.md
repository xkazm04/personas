## REQUIREMENT

# Refactor credential NavBridge to use React Context instead of mutable exports

## Metadata
- **Category**: code_quality

## Description
useCredentialViewFSM.ts exports a mutable credentialNav object (_currentKey, _navigateFn) to bypass React tree limitations for the Sidebar. Refactor this to use a standard React Context provider at the layout level.

## Reasoning
Mutable module-level variables for navigation state are an anti-pattern in React that breaks concurrent rendering and hot module replacement. A proper Context cleanly shares the FSM dispatcher without module side-effects.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Credential Management

**Description**: Store, edit, and organize API credentials and secrets. Browse credentials in a list or picker, view card details with health checks, manage rotation policies, and connect credentials to specific connector types with schema-driven forms.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
