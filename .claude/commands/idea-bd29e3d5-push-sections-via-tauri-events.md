## REQUIREMENT

# Push sections via Tauri events instead of polling

## Metadata

## Description
Currently streaming sections are stored in job_state and retrieved via snapshot polling (1-10s intervals). The Rust side already emits n8n-transform-output events per line. Adding a dedicated n8n-transform-section event emitted from build_section_callbacks (which already has the section data) would let the frontend receive sections instantly via Tauri event listeners instead of waiting for the next poll cycle. The polling path would remain as a fallback for session restoration.

## Reasoning
Section-by-section streaming is the flagship UX for the transform chat -- users watch sections appear one by one. With polling, there is a 1-10 second delay between the Rust side completing a section and the frontend rendering it. Push-based delivery would make sections appear within milliseconds, creating a dramatically more responsive streaming experience.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: n8n Transform & Platforms

**Description**: n8n workflow import, AI-powered transformation to personas, streaming sessions, platform definitions, and design conversations.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
