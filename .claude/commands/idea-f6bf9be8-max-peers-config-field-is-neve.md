## REQUIREMENT

# max_peers config field is never enforced

## Description
NetworkConfig defines max_peers: 32 but neither connect_to_peer nor handle_incoming checks the current connection count against this limit. A misbehaving peer or LAN flood can open unlimited connections, exhausting file descriptors and memory. Fix by adding a connections.read().await.len() >= max_peers guard at the top of both connect_to_peer and handle_incoming, returning an error or closing the connection with a capacity-exceeded reason code.

## Reasoning
Without enforcement, a single malicious node on the LAN can saturate the endpoint. The config field already exists, giving users the false impression that connections are bounded. This is a resource exhaustion vector that is trivial to exploit on a shared network.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: P2P Protocol & Transport

**Description**: Peer-to-peer networking with mDNS discovery, QUIC transport, protocol messaging, manifest synchronization.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
