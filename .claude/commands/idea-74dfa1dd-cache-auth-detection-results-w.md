## REQUIREMENT

# Cache auth detection results with TTL

## Metadata
- **Category**: performance
- **Effort**: High (3/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (7/3)
- **Scan Type**: perf_optimizer

## Description
detect_authenticated_services spawns 9 CLI subprocesses and copies+queries browser cookie SQLite DBs on every call. Add a 5-minute in-memory cache (Arc<Mutex<Option<(Instant, Vec<AuthDetection>)>>>) in AppState so repeated calls during the setup wizard reuse the previous scan. Invalidate on explicit user action or after TTL. This turns a multi-second blocking operation into an instant return for the common case.

## Reasoning
The auth detection flow is called during onboarding and connector setup. Each call spawns 9 processes with 3-second timeouts and copies browser cookie databases � easily 3-5 seconds of wall time. Users exploring the wizard trigger this repeatedly. Caching eliminates redundant subprocess spawning and disk I/O for the 95% case where auth state has not changed.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Authentication & Security

**Description**: Authentication flows, IPC auth token validation, AES-256-GCM encryption, OS keyring integration, desktop security, and URL safety.

- `src/api/auth/auth.ts`
- `src/api/auth/authDetect.ts`
- `src/stores/authStore.ts`
- `src-tauri/src/commands/infrastructure/auth.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/commands/credentials/auth_detect.rs`

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
