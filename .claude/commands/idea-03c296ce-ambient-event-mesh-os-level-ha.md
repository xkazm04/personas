## REQUIREMENT

# Ambient Event Mesh & OS-Level Haptics

## Metadata
- **Category**: ui
- **Effort**: Unknown (9/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (10/3)
- **Scan Type**: moonshot_architect
- **Generated**: 3/1/2026, 4:26:08 PM

## Description
Extend the event bus to deep OS-level hooks (file system, window manager, peripheral input) and provide interactive haptic/visual feedback. Agents can "feel" the environment and respond to user actions in real-time across the entire desktop workspace.

## Reasoning
AI agents shouldn't live in a siloed window. By bridging the gap between software agents and the physical/OS workspace, we create a "magical" experience where the computer itself becomes the agent.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Triggers & Event Routing

**Description**: Define event triggers that automatically activate agents. Configure trigger conditions, build event flows with visual diagrams, manage event subscriptions, and route events between agents in the system.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
