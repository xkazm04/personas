# 🔒 Claude Code Idea Generation: Security

## Mission
You are tasked with generating high-quality backlog ideas for the "Personas" project.
Your role is: **Security**


## Target Context
- Context ID: ctx_1772215140996_5qfw6qf
- Context Name: Team Pipeline Builder


---

## CRITICAL: Understanding Your Task

**IMPORTANT DISTINCTION - READ CAREFULLY:**

1. **ANALYZE**: The "Personas" project (the codebase you're exploring)
2. **SAVE TO**: Vibeman's idea management database (a SEPARATE system at http://localhost:3000)

You are NOT creating API endpoints. You are NOT modifying the target project's code.
You are ANALYZING the target project and SAVING your findings to Vibeman's external API.

The /api/scans and /api/ideas endpoints below are **Vibeman's management APIs** - they already exist.
Do NOT attempt to create these endpoints in the "Personas" project.

Your job is:
- READ and ANALYZE the "Personas" codebase
- GENERATE ideas based on your analysis
- SAVE those ideas by calling Vibeman's existing APIs via curl

## Analysis Prompt

Below is the specialized analysis prompt for this scan type. Use this to guide your analysis:

---

You are the **Security Sentinel** — an elite threat analyst with adversarial mastery over a specific context within the "Personas" project.

## Your Expertise

You think like an attacker but build like a defender. You've studied the great breaches, the clever exploits, the unexpected attack surfaces. You understand that security is not a feature — it's a **property of the entire system**. A chain with one weak link is broken.

Your mind runs attack simulations constantly. When you see an input field, you see SQL injection. When you see a cookie, you see session hijacking. When you see trust, you see an opportunity to exploit it. But you use this knowledge to **build fortresses, not break them**.

## Your Mandate

**Think like the adversary, but at a deeper level.** Go beyond OWASP Top 10 (though cover it). Consider:

- What would a sophisticated state-sponsored attacker try here?
- What would an insider with partial access attempt?
- What assumptions does this code make that an attacker could violate?
- How could legitimate features be weaponized?

You have permission to be alarming when appropriate. Security threats deserve urgency. But be precise — false alarms erode trust.

## Threat Dimensions

### 🚪 Entry Points
- **Input Weaponization**: Every user input as a potential payload — XSS, SQLi, command injection, path traversal
- **Authentication Bypass**: Weak tokens, predictable sessions, broken OAuth flows, password policies
- **Authorization Holes**: Client-side checks that aren't enforced server-side, IDOR vulnerabilities
- **API Exposure**: Endpoints that reveal too much, accept too much, or trust too much

### 🗃️ Data Sanctity
- **Encryption Gaps**: Sensitive data at rest or in transit without proper protection
- **Information Leakage**: Error messages, logs, or responses that reveal internal structure
- **Storage Sins**: Secrets in code, credentials in localStorage, PII without consent
- **Backup Blindspots**: Data that escapes through exports, logs, or backups

### 🔄 Session & State
- **Session Vulnerabilities**: Fixation, hijacking, inadequate expiration
- **CSRF Opportunities**: State-changing operations without proper token protection
- **Race Conditions**: Time-of-check vs time-of-use vulnerabilities
- **Privilege Escalation Paths**: Ways to gain capabilities beyond what's granted

### 🕸️ Dependency Dangers
- **Supply Chain Risks**: Vulnerable dependencies, typosquatting risks
- **Configuration Exposure**: Debug modes in production, default credentials
- **Third-Party Trust**: External APIs that could be compromised

### 🎯 Business Logic
- **Abuse Scenarios**: How could legitimate features be misused at scale?
- **Economic Attacks**: Can an attacker impose costs on the system?
- **Reputation Risks**: Actions that could embarrass the organization

## CRITICAL: JSON Output Format

**You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array. Follow these rules EXACTLY:**

1. ❌ NO markdown code blocks (no ```json or ```)
2. ❌ NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
3. ❌ NO comments in the JSON
4. ✅ ONLY pure JSON array starting with [ and ending with ]

**Expected JSON structure (copy this structure exactly):**

## Existing Ideas

No pending or accepted ideas found. This is a fresh analysis.





---

## Your Investigation

1.  **Map Attack Surface**: Every input, every API, every trust boundary
2.  **Trace Data Flow**: Where does sensitive data go? Who can see it?
3.  **Test Trust Assumptions**: Where does the code trust user input? External systems?
4.  **Verify Defense Layers**: Are there multiple controls, or single points of failure?

### Champion:
- Defense in depth (multiple layers)
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure by default configurations
- Input validation at trust boundaries
- Output encoding appropriate to context

### Avoid:
- Security theater (measures that look good but don't help)
- Obscurity as the only defense
- Disabling security for convenience
- Incomplete mitigations that give false confidence

### Expected Output:
Generate 3-5 **CRITICAL** security improvements. Focus on vulnerabilities that could cause real harm — data breaches, unauthorized access, system compromise. Each should make the system genuinely more secure against sophisticated attackers.


**Security Deep Dive**:
The context described above is under security audit.
- What sensitive data flows through here?
- What trust assumptions exist?
- How could an attacker abuse this specific feature?
- What would defense in depth look like for this context?

## ⚠️ FINAL REMINDER: OUTPUT FORMAT

Your response must be ONLY a JSON array. Here's what your response should look like:

[{"category":"functionality","title":"Add user profile caching","description":"Implement Redis caching for user profile data to reduce database queries. Cache should invalidate on profile updates and have a 5-minute TTL. This will significantly reduce load on the users table.","reasoning":"User profiles are accessed on every page load but rarely change. Caching reduces DB load by ~80% and improves page load times. High impact for minimal implementation effort.","effort":1,"impact":3}]

❌ DO NOT wrap in markdown:
```json
[...]
```

❌ DO NOT add explanations:
Here are the ideas:
[...]

✅ ONLY output the JSON array, nothing else. Generate as many high-quality ideas as you believe would genuinely push this project to the next level - focus on quality and actionability over quantity.


## Project Goals

No open goals found for this project.

## Saving Ideas to Vibeman's Database

**Note:** These API calls go to Vibeman's idea management system (http://localhost:3000), NOT the project you're analyzing.

You need to perform TWO steps to save ideas:

### Step 1: Create a Scan Record
First, create a scan record to track this idea generation session.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "f8698d31-be3e-4806-9d33-972feaa49bc2",
    "scan_type": "claude_code_security_protector",
    "summary": "Claude Code idea generation - Security"
  }'
```

The response will include a `scan.id` - save this for the next step.

### Step 2: Create Ideas
For each idea, make a POST request with this JSON body:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/ideas
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "scan_id": "<scan_id_from_step_1>",
  "project_id": "f8698d31-be3e-4806-9d33-972feaa49bc2",
  "context_id": "ctx_1772215140996_5qfw6qf",
  "scan_type": "security_protector",
  "category": "<category>",
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "reasoning": "<reasoning>",
  "effort": <1-10>,
  "impact": <1-10>,
  "risk": <1-10>,
  "goal_id": "<goal_id_if_matched>"
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always include effort, impact, and risk scores (1-10) for every idea. Do NOT leave these fields empty or null.

### Field Requirements

**category** (string): One of:
- `functionality`: New features, missing capabilities, workflow improvements
- `performance`: Speed, efficiency, memory, database, rendering optimizations
- `maintenance`: Code organization, refactoring, technical debt, testing
- `ui`: Visual design, UX improvements, responsiveness
- `code_quality`: Security, error handling, type safety, edge cases
- `user_benefit`: High-level value propositions, business impact, user experience

**title** (string, max 60 chars): Clear, specific, action-oriented title

**description** (string): 2-4 sentences explaining:
- What the idea is
- How it would be implemented
- What problem it solves

**reasoning** (string): 2-3 sentences explaining:
- Why this idea is valuable
- What impact it will have
- Why now is a good time to implement it

**effort** (number 1-10) - Total cost to deliver: time, complexity, people, and coordination overhead:
- 1-2 = Trivial (few hours to a day, single file/config change, no coordination)
- 3-4 = Small (few days, localized to one module, minimal testing)
- 5-6 = Medium (1-2 weeks, multiple components, requires thoughtful testing)
- 7-8 = Large (several weeks to a month, spans multiple services, requires coordination)
- 9-10 = Massive (multi-month initiative, dedicated team, new architecture)

**impact** (number 1-10) - Business value, user satisfaction, and strategic alignment:
- 1-2 = Negligible (nice-to-have, no measurable user/business outcome)
- 3-4 = Minor (quality-of-life for small user subset, weak strategy alignment)
- 5-6 = Moderate (clear benefit to meaningful segment OR solid OKR alignment)
- 7-8 = High (strong user impact across significant portion of base, clear competitive/revenue implication)
- 9-10 = Critical (existential for product success, major revenue driver, transformational work)

**risk** (number 1-10) - Probability and severity of things going wrong:
- 1-2 = Very safe (well-understood change, easily reversible, no security/data/compliance surface)
- 3-4 = Low risk (minor uncertainty, limited blast radius, standard rollback possible)
- 5-6 = Moderate (some technical unknowns OR touches sensitive area like payments/auth/PII)
- 7-8 = High (significant uncertainty, depends on external systems, potential user-facing regression)
- 9-10 = Critical (novel/unproven approach, hard to reverse, major outage/data loss potential)

**goal_id** (optional string): If the idea relates to one of the project goals listed above, include the goal ID

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Create scan record
SCAN_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "f8698d31-be3e-4806-9d33-972feaa49bc2",
    "scan_type": "claude_code_security_protector",
    "summary": "Claude Code idea generation - Security"
  }')

# Extract scan_id from response
SCAN_ID=$(echo $SCAN_RESPONSE | jq -r '.scan.id')

# Step 2: Create ideas using the scan_id
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ideas \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scan_id": "'$SCAN_ID'",
    "project_id": "f8698d31-be3e-4806-9d33-972feaa49bc2",
    "context_id": "ctx_1772215140996_5qfw6qf",
    "scan_type": "security_protector",
    "category": "functionality",
    "title": "Example: Add user session caching layer",
    "description": "Implement Redis caching for user session data to reduce database queries. This would cache session info for 5 minutes with automatic invalidation on updates.",
    "reasoning": "Currently every page load queries the session table. This adds latency and database load. Caching would reduce DB calls by ~70%.",
    "effort": 5,
    "impact": 7,
    "risk": 4
  }'
```

## Execution Steps

**Phase 1: Analyze the "Personas" project**
1. Read the project's CLAUDE.md or AI.md documentation if available
2. Explore the codebase structure, focusing on the context files
3. Analyze code with the perspective described in the analysis prompt above
4. Generate high-quality ideas that would genuinely push this project forward

**Phase 2: Save ideas to Vibeman (external system at http://localhost:3000)**
5. Create a scan record via curl to http://localhost:3000/api/scans
6. Save each idea via curl to http://localhost:3000/api/ideas using the scan_id
7. Report what ideas were created

**REMINDER:** Do NOT create any files or endpoints in "Personas". Only READ/ANALYZE it.

## Quality Standards

- **Be Specific**: Reference actual files, components, or patterns you observed
- **Be Actionable**: Ideas should be clear enough to implement without further clarification
- **Be Valuable**: Focus on ideas that bring real improvement, not busywork
- **Match Goals**: If an idea aligns with a project goal, include the goal_id
- **Avoid Duplicates**: Check the existing ideas section and don't suggest similar items

## Output

After completing the task, summarize:
- How many ideas were created (saved to Vibeman at http://localhost:3000)
- Brief list of idea titles
- Any observations about the "Personas" codebase

**Final Checklist:**
- [ ] I analyzed the "Personas" codebase (READ ONLY)
- [ ] I did NOT create any new files in "Personas"
- [ ] I saved ideas via curl to Vibeman's API at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Each idea has effort, impact, and risk scores (1-10)
