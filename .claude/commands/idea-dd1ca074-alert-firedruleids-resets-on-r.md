## REQUIREMENT

# Alert firedRuleIds resets on reload causing re-fire

## Metadata
- **Category**: maintenance

## Description
The firedRuleIds Set in alertSlice.ts is a module-level variable that resets on every page reload. This means all alert rules that match current metrics will fire again immediately after any app restart or hard refresh, flooding the user with duplicate alerts. Fix by persisting the last-fired timestamp per rule in localStorage alongside the rule itself, and suppressing re-fire within a configurable cooldown window (e.g. 1 hour).

## Reasoning
Users who configure alert rules will see every rule fire on every app launch, making alerts unreliable and noisy. This undermines trust in the alerting system. The fix is small (add a firedAt map to localStorage) but the impact on alert usability is significant.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Dashboard & Analytics

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
