## REQUIREMENT

# Add composite DB indexes for lab result queries

## Metadata
- **Category**: performance
- **Effort**: High (3/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (6/3)
- **Scan Type**: perf_optimizer

## Description
All four lab repos (ab.rs, arena.rs, eval.rs, matrix.rs) query results with WHERE run_id = ? ORDER BY scenario_name, model_id and runs with WHERE persona_id = ? ORDER BY created_at DESC, but no composite indexes exist. Add indexes on (run_id, scenario_name, model_id) for results tables and (persona_id, created_at DESC) for runs tables. Also replace SELECT * with column projections in list queries to avoid fetching large output_preview and tool_calls columns.

## Reasoning
Without indexes, SQLite performs full table scans on every results fetch and run listing. As experiment history grows (dozens of runs � hundreds of results each), these queries degrade linearly. Composite indexes make these lookups O(log n) and column projection reduces I/O by skipping 1KB+ text columns in list views. This is the foundation for scaling the lab beyond toy usage.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Prompt Lab

**Description**: A/B testing, arena comparisons, evaluation matrices, prompt versioning with diffs, and experiment history for optimizing persona prompts.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
