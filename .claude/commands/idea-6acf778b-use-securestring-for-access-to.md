## REQUIREMENT

# Use SecureString for access_token in AuthStateInner

## Description
AuthStateInner stores access_token as Option<String> (auth.rs:58), but the codebase already has SecureString (crypto.rs) with zeroize-on-drop semantics specifically designed for tokens. Replace access_token with Option<SecureString> so the JWT is zeroized when the session ends or token rotates, matching the stated security posture of EncryptedToken and SecureString. This requires updating callers to use .expose_secret() for short-lived borrows.

## Reasoning
The SecureString type was explicitly created to prevent tokens from persisting in memory (crypto.rs:107-116), yet the most sensitive in-memory token � the Supabase JWT that grants cloud API access � uses a plain String. A memory dump or crash report could leak this token. Aligning the types makes the security model self-consistent and trustworthy.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Authentication & Security

**Description**: Authentication flows, IPC auth token validation, AES-256-GCM encryption, OS keyring integration, desktop security, and URL safety.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
