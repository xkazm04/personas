/**
 * The generic hands, in the page's main world — docs/architecture/browser-control.md §2a.
 *
 * PORTED from C:\Users\kazda\kiro\athena-portable\apps\desktop\src-tauri\src\hands.js at
 * athena-portable c5ec8ca. Three changes, each marked PERSONAS below:
 *
 *   1. the namespace is `personas-hands` and the marker global `__personasHands`;
 *   2. `page_find` also reports the page's LANDMARKS, its title and its url, so one round trip
 *      answers `browser_snapshot` instead of three;
 *   3. a tenth hand, `page_console`, drains a ring buffer of the last 200 console lines that this
 *      script installs at document start — `browser_console` has nowhere else to read from,
 *      because a console line that happened before anybody asked is gone by the time they do.
 *
 * Tier 1 is what a page chose to offer. This is what an agent can do on a page that offered
 * nothing, which is nearly every page: read it, find things in it, and operate the things it
 * found. It is the difference between "an agent for apps with a plug-in" and "an agent for the
 * web the operator already has open".
 *
 * Three rules run through everything below.
 *
 * **A ref is minted here and nowhere else.** `page_find` and `page_read` hand back opaque
 * `ref_<hex>` tokens; every operating hand takes one. A model never sees a CSS selector and can
 * never compose one, so it cannot reach an element the page did not just show it. A ref is scoped
 * to one document: navigating bumps a generation and every ref minted before it answers
 * `unknown_ref` rather than acting on whatever now occupies that position.
 *
 * **Nothing throws.** Every hand answers `{ ok, output, reason }` and a refusal is a result. A
 * hand that rejected would leave the relay holding a pending entry until its timer, and a panel
 * spinning on a call nobody remembers making.
 *
 * **Bounded output announces itself.** Page text is unbounded by nature — a long list view is a
 * megabyte — so every read is cut and says `(showing N of M)`, in the same words the Python side
 * uses (README section 2, invariant 4).
 *
 * The class of each hand is not decided here. These are *capabilities*; the gate decides, and
 * README section 3.3 makes every hand `GATED` on first sight for a new origin whatever its flags
 * say.
