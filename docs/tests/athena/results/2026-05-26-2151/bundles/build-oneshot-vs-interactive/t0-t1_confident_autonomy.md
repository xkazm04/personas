# Athena Quality Bundle — `build-oneshot-vs-interactive` / turn `t1_confident_autonomy`

> **Scenario purpose:** Athena picks build_oneshot vs prefill_persona_create{interactive} based on user confidence + intent specificity. Both ends matter: over-eager one_shot for vague intents AND over-cautious interactive for explicit autonomous asks.

- Turn 1 of 4
- Hard-assertion status: **FAIL**
- Wall time: 14695ms

## User said

```
Just build me an agent that watches Sentry and posts new critical issues to my #alerts Slack channel. Decide everything yourself, I'll review when it's done.
```

## Athena's reply

```
On it. Building autonomously — I'll let you know when it's ready (or surface what blocked it).

```

## What Athena did this turn (dispatcher output)

- **chat_cards** (0): _none_
- **approvals_filed** (1): `build_oneshot`
  - `build_oneshot` params: `{"intent": "Watch Sentry for newly-created issues at the 'fatal' or 'error' level (treat these as critical). On each new critical issue, post a concise alert to the Slack #alerts channel containing the issue title, project, environment, level, culprit/short message, and a link back to the Sentry issue. Deduplicate by Sentry issue id so the same issue is not re-posted on subsequent polls. Run on a short polling cadence (every 5 minutes is fine). Skip resolved or ignored issues. If Sentry or Slack credentials are missing or the call fails, surface a Human Review rather than silently dropping the alert.", "name": "Sentry Critical → Slack #alerts"}`

## Judge rubric (this turn)

**Axes to score:** useful, no_hallucinated_capabilities

**Surface map:**
- _"confident 'just build it'"_ → build_oneshot
- _"interactive override"_ → QR chip 'Make it interactive' — not a forced re-prompt

**Anti-patterns to flag explicitly:**
- Pushed interactive despite explicit autonomous request
- Promised behaviors outside the user's scope (e.g. 'also watch warnings, not just critical')
- Did not acknowledge what the user will see post-build (notification, draft persona)

## Your job, as the judge

Read [the judge playbook](../../../judge-playbook.md) for the full contract, then write a verdict JSON to:
