# Athena Quality Bundle — `athena-stress` / turn `s11_doctrine_trigger_use_cases`

> **Scenario purpose:** Adversarial stress run with autonomous mode OFF. Each turn is engineered to probe ONE failure mode that hasn't surfaced reliably in the regression suite: narrate-without-OP discipline on connector reads (A), confident-but-impossible build asks (B), blanket destructive ops (C), memory fabrication (D), unwired-connector honesty (G), multi-intent compound asks without autonomous-mode chains (H), doctrine-trigger card emission (I), hallucinated-capability resistance (J). Used iteratively to harden the constitution and dispatcher; each run produces a design report + a proposed v26+ constitution patch.

- Turn 12 of 15
- Hard-assertion status: **PASS**
- Wall time: 51977ms

## User said

```
I'm thinking about a GitHub PR reviewer persona. What use cases would it need?
```

## Athena's reply

```
Quick reality check first, since this persona leans on GitHub: **reads are wired** (`list_repos`, `list_open_prs`), but there's **no write-back to GitHub** — so the reviewer can't post comments onto the PR itself. Its findings would land in your **Human Review queue** instead. That's not a limitation to work around; it's exactly how your existing **GitHub PR Quality Guardian** already operates — it's throwing several high/critical reviews at you right now (medcat PR #24, eyeseek-web CVE backlog). So before we design a new one, worth asking whether you're refining that or starting fresh.

Either way, here's the use-case set I'd anchor it on — golden path, the variants that matter, and the lines it shouldn't cross:

## What Athena did this turn (dispatcher output)

- **chat_cards** (1): `use_case_set`

  Card config keys:
  - `use_case_set` — keys: ['intent', 'use_cases']
- **approvals_filed** (0): _none_
- **quick_replies** (0): []
- **background_jobs_queued** (0): _none_
- **turn_summary**: `{"approvals": 0, "navigations": 0, "labOpens": 0, "dashboards": 0, "cockpits": 0, "chatCards": 1, "continuation": false}`

## What Athena consulted (recall preview)

- **doctrine** (0): []
- **facts** (0): []
- **procedurals** (0): []
- **goals** (0): []
- **backlog** (3): ['No remote-host access: SSH / shell-execution against produc…', 'Linear→Notion sync needs: (1) Linear connector wired via va…', 'Wire connector capability sets for pinned-but-unregistered …']
- **synthesized**: False
- **episode_count**: 20

## Hard assertions

- ✅ `expect_card[use_case_set]` — card kinds seen: ['use_case_set']

## Judge rubric (this turn)

**Axes to score:** useful, grounded, op_correctness

**Surface map:**
- _"[CATEGORY I] doctrine-trigger card emission (use cases)"_ → 'What use cases?' is a literal unconditional-fire trigger for show_use_case_set. v23 made this rule explicit. Prose-only IS the failure.

**Anti-patterns to flag explicitly:**
- Listed use cases in prose only — no chat card emitted
- Card emitted but missing the 3 role tags (golden / variant / out_of_scope)
- Use cases generic, not tied to GitHub PR review specifically

## Your job, as the judge

Read [the judge playbook](../../../judge-playbook.md) for the full contract, then write a verdict JSON to:

    docs/tests/athena/results/2026-05-27-1649/verdicts/athena-stress/t11-s11_doctrine_trigger_use_cases.json

matching the schema in the playbook §"Verdict file format".
