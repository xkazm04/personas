# Dev Tools

> An AI-guided development pipeline that turns any codebase into a managed project — scanned into semantic contexts, mined for improvement ideas by 21 specialized agents, triaged Tinder-style, executed as tasks, and shipped as draft pull requests with agent reasoning attached.

The plugin lives at `src/features/plugins/dev-tools/` and is exposed through the **Plugins → Dev Tools** entry in the sidebar. The Rust surface lives at `src-tauri/src/commands/infrastructure/dev_tools.rs` plus sibling modules for the long-running operations (`context_generation.rs`, `idea_scanner.rs`, `task_executor.rs`).

---

## What it does

Dev Tools treats each linked repository as a *Dev Project* with its own lifecycle. The project moves through eight domains, each visible as a tab:

| Domain | Direction | Storage / artifact |
|---|---|---|
| **Overview** (GitHub / GitLab / Sentry stats) | External → App | Read-through cache of open issues, PRs, commits, unresolved errors |
| **Projects** (CRUD + GitHub linking + goals) | App | `dev_projects` table, 1 active project at a time |
| **Context Map** (semantic code domains) | App ↔ Codebase | `dev_context_groups` + `dev_contexts`, generated from a filesystem walk |
| **Idea Scanner** (21 LLM agents) | App → LLM → App | `dev_ideas` rows tagged with `scan_type` + per-scan history |
| **Idea Triage** (accept / reject / delete) | Human → App | Idea status transitions; optional auto-triage rules |
| **Task Runner** (batched execution) | App → LLM → App | `dev_tasks` rows + live output buffer + PR Bridge card |
| **Lifecycle** (goals + setup + competitions) | App | Goal constellation, Dev Clone adoption, strategy competitions |
| **Skills** (markdown-based dev patterns) | Disk ↔ App | `.md` files under the user's skills directory |

Ideas are linked to the agent that proposed them via `DevIdea.scan_type` (a string matching a `ScanAgentDef.key`). Tasks are linked back to the originating idea via `DevTask.source_idea_id`. That single foreign-ish link is what makes the whole loop work: it lets the PR Bridge cite the agent that proposed the work, and lets the Agent Scoreboard score each agent on whether its ideas actually ship.

---

## User flow

The eight tabs are sequenced so a new project can walk top-to-bottom exactly once, then loops through **Scanner → Triage → Runner → PR** forever after.

### 1. Projects — register a codebase

1. Open **Plugins → Dev Tools → Projects**.
2. Click **New Project** and pick a local folder. The name is auto-filled from the directory name, the tech stack can be set visually, and you can attach a GitHub URL to unlock Overview stats and the PR Bridge later.
3. After creation, a **Generate Context Map** CTA appears — skip it only if you intend to define contexts manually.
4. A top-of-page **ProjectSelector** banner persists across every other tab so the active project is always visible. With zero projects it becomes a prompt → "Create Project" CTA; with one it collapses to a label; with many it becomes a dropdown.

### 2. Context Map — scan the codebase into semantic domains

1. Open **Context Map**. Groups are displayed as color-tagged columns; contexts within each group show keywords, entry points, and file-path count.
2. Click **Scan Codebase**. The Rust backend walks the filesystem, clusters files by structural signal (imports, directory layout, naming), and returns `ContextGroup`/`ContextItem` rows. A **ScanOverlay** streams progress lines and can be cancelled mid-flight.
3. Scans survive navigation — a status-resync poll on mount reattaches to in-flight jobs via `dev_tools_get_scan_codebase_status`, so leaving the tab during a long scan and coming back picks up where you left off.
4. Completion fires an **in-app notification** (TitleBar bell) with the counts — groups created, contexts created, files mapped — and a redirect link.

### 3. Idea Scanner — run 21 specialized agents

1. Open **Idea Scanner**. Agents are grouped into four categories: **Technical, User Experience, Business, Mastermind**.
2. Pick agents manually (single, multiple, or **Select All**) and press **Run Scan**, or press **Auto-Scan** to iterate every mapped context and pick agents by keyword heuristic (see *Scan Agents → auto-match rules* below).
3. A **ScanProgress** card streams live progress while the run is active. Ideas arrive as `DevIdea` rows with category, agent key, effort/impact/risk (1-10 each), and an optional `reasoning` blob.
4. The **Results** grid shows per-scan idea cards with color-coded level badges. A **Scan History** table below records timestamps, token counts, duration, and the agent set for every past scan.
5. The **Agent Performance** collapsible panel (see *Agent Scoreboard* below) surfaces per-agent accept / implementation / avg-impact stats aggregated across the whole project.

### 4. Idea Triage — Tinder-style accept / reject

1. Open **Idea Triage**. Pending ideas form a 3-card stack in the center; sidebar filters narrow by category, scan type, effort range, and risk range.
2. Swipe right (or ➡ / Z) to accept, left (or ⬅ / A) to reject. The top card drags physically via Framer Motion; the border glows red/green based on drag direction.
3. The optional **Auto-Triage Rules** panel above the stack lets you define conditional rules (e.g. "if effort ≤ 3 and impact ≥ 7 → accept") that are applied in bulk via `dev_tools_run_triage_rules`.
4. Progress bar + status badges (accepted / rejected / pending) update live. A `?` keyboard shortcut opens the full shortcuts overlay.

### 5. Task Runner — execute accepted ideas

1. Open **Task Runner**. Click **Batch from Accepted** to materialize one `DevTask` per accepted idea (source-linked via `source_idea_id`), or **New Task** to create an ad-hoc task with a **Quick / Campaign / Deep Build** depth picker.
2. Press **Start Batch**. Tasks transition through phases: `analyzing → planning → implementing → validating → complete`, visible as a tinted progress bar per card.
3. Output streams live via the **TaskOutputPanel** (expandable). Context warnings from the LLM (e.g. "couldn't load referenced file") are flagged as a **Partial context** badge with the full list revealed on expand.
4. A **Self-Healing** panel above the queue watches for failures and offers one-click retries.
5. **PR Bridge** (see *Proposal A* below) appears on every completed task — a collapsible card with the suggested branch name, commit message, PR title and body (with agent citation), plus three actions: *Copy PR body*, *Prepare branch & commit* (uses `dev_tools_create_branch` + `dev_tools_commit_changes`), *Open draft PR on GitHub* (via `@tauri-apps/plugin-shell` with GitHub's `quick_pull=1` URL pre-fill).

### 6. Overview — live health signals

1. Open **Overview**. A two-column layout shows **Codebase** (GitHub / GitLab) on the left and **Monitoring** (Sentry) on the right.
2. Each card handles five states: **empty** (no credential) → **unmapped** (credential exists but not linked to this project) → **loading** → **connected** (with stat tiles) → **error** (with retry).
3. Connecting Sentry uses an inline form (`MonitoringLinkForm`) that writes the credential ID + project slug back to `dev_projects.monitoring_*`.
4. Stat tiles use a static color token table — dynamic Tailwind classes (`bg-${color}-500/15`) are banned here because the JIT can't see them.

### 7. Lifecycle — goals, setup, competitions

1. Open **Lifecycle**. Three sub-tabs sit at the top: **Setup**, **Goals**, **Competitions**.
2. **Setup** explains the autonomous Dev Clone flow with **Readiness Gates** (Dev project, GitHub repo, Dev Clone template). One-click **Adopt Dev Clone** registers the persona, its tools, and its triggers.
3. **Goals** renders a force-directed **Goal Constellation** (via `forceLayout.ts`) plus a Kanban board with `your turn / agent's turn / done` swim lanes. Goals can have dependencies, and tasks can link to a goal so progress propagates.
4. **Competitions** spawns 2–4 strategy variants in Claude Code worktrees racing against the same prompt. The **StrategyLeaderboard** ranks them by quality score + duration. A **WinnerInsightDialog** captures *why* a strategy won for future prompt tuning.

### 8. Skills — browse dev patterns

1. Open **Skills**. The left pane lists markdown files from the user's skills directory with a fuzzy-search box.
2. The right pane renders the selected file with an inline **Edit** toggle that writes changes back to disk.
3. A safety banner is shown when a file fails to load — editing is disabled to prevent data loss.

```

Each arrow is stateful and survives navigation — scan jobs, task runs, and PR branches all persist in SQLite and resume on re-mount.

## Strongest use case (speculation)

> **A single human reviewer supervising twenty specialized AI reviewers — and every accepted idea shipping as a draft PR with the proposing agent's reasoning embedded.**

Most AI-coding products sit at one end of two axes: they are either (a) a single chat window where one generalist agent tries to do everything, or (b) a fully autonomous pipeline where the human only sees the final output. Both break for real codebases — the generalist misses domain-specific bugs, and the autonomous pipeline merges slop without review.

Dev Tools occupies the middle. You are never asked to decide *what* to look for — twenty-one specialists (Security Auditor, UX Reviewer, Tech Debt Tracker, Bounty Hunter, …) each scan the codebase from their own angle and each drop their own ideas into one shared queue. You triage the queue swipe-by-swipe in a minute, accept what's worth doing, and press **Start Batch**. Tasks run in parallel, each one completes, each one produces a draft PR with the proposing agent cited in the description.

The killer flow is:

1. Security Auditor proposes *"session tokens stored in localStorage survive XSS"*. The idea lands in the triage queue tagged `🔒 Security Auditor` with effort 4, impact 9, risk 3.
2. You swipe right. One click. Less than a second.
3. **Batch from Accepted** materializes the idea into a task. The task executes, writes the migration to httpOnly cookies, runs your test command, and emits `TASK_EXEC_COMPLETE`.
4. The **PR Bridge** card unfolds on the completed task: branch `dev-tools/session-token-xss-3a7b1c2`, commit `Move session tokens from localStorage to httpOnly cookies\n\nProposed by Security Auditor 🔒 via Personas Dev Tools.\n\n{reasoning}`, PR body with category / effort / impact / risk / description / full agent reasoning.
5. Click **Prepare branch & commit** → click **Open draft PR on GitHub**. GitHub's create-PR page opens with title and body pre-filled.
6. Reviewer on your team sees a draft PR that *explains itself* — the agent's reasoning for *why* the change is worth making travels with the code.
7. The **Agent Scoreboard** notices the PR merged. Security Auditor's accept rate ticks up to 81%. Next week's auto-scan weights its suggestions slightly higher.

No other product lets a human supervise this many specialists this efficiently. The lock-in is weak (it's your code, your repo, your PRs), the leverage is extreme (the scoreboard compounds), and the ceiling is the number of agents you trust — not the number of prompts you can type.

---

## Five development directions

Proposals A (PR Bridge) and B (Agent Scoreboard) are already shipped. What follows is the next five.

### 1. Cross-project refactor planner — find and lift shared code

Today every project is scanned in isolation. The `dev_tools_search_across_projects` and `dev_tools_get_cross_project_map` commands already exist but are under-used. Build a UI that:

- Detects near-duplicate functions, types, and config blocks across linked projects (using the cross-project search index).
- Proposes "extract to shared package" batches, with a **dry-run impact report**: which call sites change, estimated effort, suggested package location.
- Surfaces the diff inline with a one-click "create shared-library project" action that spins up a new dev project pre-seeded with the extracted code.

This converts Dev Tools from a single-repo scanner into a portfolio-level architect. It is uniquely possible here because you have the cross-project index nobody else has.

### 2. Live Tech Radar + upgrade debt dashboard

The `dev_tools_get_tech_radar`, `dev_tools_get_risk_matrix`, and `dev_tools_get_dependency_graph` commands exist as stubs. Light them up:

- Auto-extract dependency graphs from every linked project's lockfiles (package.json, Cargo.toml, requirements.txt).
- Render an interactive **radial Tech Radar** (adopt / trial / assess / hold) across the whole portfolio.
- Flag **version drift** across projects (React 18 vs 19, Node 16 vs 20) and generate ranked multi-project upgrade plans with effort / breaking-change estimates.
- Hook the radar into the Scanner: a new **Tech Debt Tracker++** agent can read radar state and propose upgrade ideas with real context.

This is the dashboard that turns a solo tool into something a tech lead keeps open all day.

### 3. Scan lineage and replay

Scans today are fire-and-forget: the history table shows a row with counts, but you cannot re-run a scan against a newer commit and diff the results. Add scan lineage:

- Each scan records the commit SHA + context version it ran against (extend `dev_scans` schema with two columns, zero breaking changes).
- A **Replay on current HEAD** button re-runs the exact same agents on the same contexts.
- A side-by-side diff viewer shows: *3 new ideas, 7 stale because the code changed, 2 still apply*.
- Stale ideas that have not been acted on for N days can be auto-rejected with a "superseded by newer scan" rejection reason.

This turns ideas from point-in-time snapshots into a living changelog, and makes the scoreboard's metrics defensible over time.

### 4. True API-driven PR creation (close the PR Bridge loop)

The PR Bridge currently ends at GitHub's pre-fill URL — the user still has to click "Create pull request" in the browser. That is the 80% solution. The 100% solution adds server-side PR creation:

- Replace the `quick_pull=1` open-in-browser step with a `dev_tools_create_draft_pr` Tauri command that hits GitHub's REST API using the user's stored GitHub credential (via `octocrab` or a raw reqwest client).
- Reviewers, labels, and milestones can be set from the PR Bridge card before submission.
- On PR merge, emit an event that updates the source idea's status to `shipped` and posts a merge signal into `dev_tools_create_goal_signal` (if the task had a `goal_id`), so goal progress advances automatically.
- Add GitLab as a second provider behind the same interface; the bridge code already handles host detection.

This is the feature that lets a team commit to Dev Tools as their real workflow, not just their ideation tool.

### 5. Per-persona task execution — route work to specialized Dev Clones

Right now every task runs through one generic task executor. Teams have specialists — a backend person, a frontend person, a tester. Let the scoreboard-verified *agents* choose the *executor*:

- Each scan agent gets a default **target persona** (e.g. Security Auditor → "Security Engineer" persona, UX Reviewer → "UI Polisher" persona).
- When a task is created from an accepted idea, the matching persona's system prompt and tools are preloaded into the executor — so the implementation inherits the reviewer's instincts.
- Per-persona overrides live in the Lifecycle → Setup tab alongside Dev Clone adoption. A visual mapping grid lets users bind any agent to any persona.
- The **Competitions** tab becomes the natural testbed: run the same task through three different personas in parallel worktrees and let the quality score pick the winner.

This is the feature that makes Dev Tools *your* tool, not a generic LLM wrapper — your team's style, your team's priorities, your team's taste — encoded in the personas each agent routes to.

---

## Scan agents — the 21-headed engine

Dev Tools ships 21 specialized scan agents defined in `src/features/plugins/dev-tools/constants/scanAgents.ts`. Each is a small prompt template + metadata record (key, label, emoji, category group, example ideas). They are the execution layer that makes the scanner worthwhile.

### Agent roster

| Category | Agents |
|---|---|
| **Technical** | Code Optimizer ⚡, Security Auditor 🔒, Architecture Analyst 🏗️, Test Strategist 🧪, Dependency Auditor 📦, Bounty Hunter 🏴‍☠️ |
| **User Experience** | UX Reviewer 🎨, Accessibility Checker ♿, Mobile Specialist 📱, Error Handler 🚨, Onboarding Designer 🎯 |
| **Business** | Feature Scout 🔭, Monetization Advisor 💰, Analytics Planner 📊, Documentation Auditor 📝, Growth Hacker 🚀 |
| **Mastermind** | Tech Debt Tracker 🏦, Innovation Catalyst 💡, Risk Assessor ⚠️, Integration Planner 🔗, DevOps Optimizer 🔧 |

### How an agent actually runs

There is one execution path and it is deliberately simple:

1. The frontend posts `dev_tools_run_scan(project_id, agent_keys[], context_id?)` via Tauri IPC.
2. `src-tauri/src/commands/infrastructure/idea_scanner.rs` spawns an async job and returns a `scan_id` immediately.
3. The job fans out one LLM call per agent per targeted context, streaming token usage and partial ideas through `IDEA_SCAN_OUTPUT` events.
4. Each returned idea is persisted as a `DevIdea` row with `scan_type = agent.key` and effort/impact/risk extracted from the response.
5. On completion, `IDEA_SCAN_STATUS` fires with `completed | completed_with_warning | failed | cancelled`; the frontend re-runs `fetchIdeas(project_id)` and the scoreboard recomputes.

Because the agent key is stored as a string, *adding a new agent is a single-file change* — append to `SCAN_AGENTS`, give it a prompt, and it shows up in the Scanner grid, participates in auto-scan, and gets its own row in the scoreboard automatically.

### Auto-match rules

The Scanner has an **Auto-Scan** mode that loops every mapped context and picks agents by regex match over the context's name, description, keywords, tech stack, API surface, and file paths (see `SCAN_MATCH_RULES` in `sub_scanner/IdeaScannerPage.tsx`). Example: a context whose keywords include `auth|login|token|secret` gets Security Auditor, a context tagged `mobile|responsive|viewport` gets Mobile Specialist. Contexts with no match fall back to Architecture Analyst + Code Optimizer as a sensible baseline.

### Agent Scoreboard (Proposal B)

A collapsible section in the Scanner aggregates per-agent performance from stored ideas + tasks: **Ideas generated · Accept % · Impl % · Avg impact · Avg effort**. Source logic is in `sub_scanner/AgentScoreboard.tsx`. Null signals (no decided ideas yet, no tasks yet) sort to the bottom; leaders ≥50% acceptance get a 🏆. The whole panel is pure client-side aggregation — zero new backend, zero new schema, zero new dependencies.

### PR Bridge (Proposal A)

A collapsible card on every completed task in the Runner. Source in `sub_runner/PrBridge.tsx`. It parses `DevProject.github_url`, looks up the originating `DevIdea` via `DevTask.source_idea_id`, slugifies the idea title into a branch name, builds a commit message + PR body with the agent citation, and wires three actions: *Copy PR body*, *Prepare branch & commit* (uses existing `dev_tools_create_branch` + `dev_tools_commit_changes` Tauri commands), *Open draft PR on GitHub* (uses `@tauri-apps/plugin-shell` and GitHub's `quick_pull=1&title=…&body=…` pre-fill URL). Non-GitHub hosts (GitLab, Bitbucket) are detected and degrade gracefully to a "copy manually" message.

All copy lives under `t.plugins.dev_tools.*` in `src/i18n/en.ts` (≈180 keys, including the new `pr_bridge_*` and `scoreboard_*` blocks). Color tokens are static maps in `constants/ideaColors.ts` — dynamic Tailwind classes (`bg-${color}-500/15`) are banned because the JIT cannot see them. Tauri IPC uses `invokeWithTimeout` from `@/lib/tauriInvoke`; raw `invoke` is blocked by ESLint. Store slices live under `src/stores/slices/system/devTools*Slice.ts` and are composed into the single `useSystemStore`.
