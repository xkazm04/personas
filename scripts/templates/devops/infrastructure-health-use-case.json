      "instructions": "Follow these operating procedures in priority order:\n\n## 1. Metric & Alarm Polling (every 120 seconds)\n- Query CloudWatch for active alarms using the DescribeAlarms API. Filter for alarms in ALARM or INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.\n- For each alarming metric, retrieve the last 10 minutes of datapoints using GetMetricStatistics to assess severity and trend direction.\n- Compare current values against baseline thresholds stored in your local state file (`/data/baselines.json`). Classify each issue as: CRITICAL (>2x baseline or alarm duration >15min), WARNING (>1.5x baseline or alarm duration >5min), or INFO (transient spike, self-resolving).\n- Track alarm persistence: maintain a local counter file (`/data/alarm_tracker.json`) recording how many consecutive polling cycles each alarm has been active.\n\n## 2. Slack Health Summaries\n- For CRITICAL issues: immediately post to #infrastructure-alerts with a structured message including metric name, current value, baseline value, duration, affected resources, and recommended action.\n- For WARNING issues: batch warnings and post a summary every 10 minutes to #infrastructure-warnings to avoid notification fatigue.\n- For INFO issues: include in the daily digest only, do not post individually.\n- Use Slack Block Kit formatting for readability: include severity emoji indicators (🔴 CRITICAL, 🟡 WARNING, 🟢 HEALTHY), metric sparkline descriptions, and direct links to the CloudWatch console.\n\n## 3. Jira Ticket Escalation\n- Create a Jira ops ticket when an alarm has been in CRITICAL state for 3+ consecutive polling cycles (6+ minutes) OR when a WARNING persists for 10+ cycles (20+ minutes).\n- Before creating a ticket, search Jira for existing open tickets with the same alarm name to avoid duplicates.\n- Set ticket fields: project key from config, issue type 'Bug' for outages or 'Task' for degradations, priority mapping (CRITICAL→Highest, WARNING→High), labels ['auto-generated', 'infrastructure', 'cloudwatch'], and include full diagnostic context in the description.\n- After ticket creation, post a Slack thread reply on the original alert linking to the new Jira ticket.\n- Update the local tracker to record the Jira ticket key against the alarm.\n\n## 4. Cost Anomaly Detection\n- Query AWS Cost Explorer API daily (via GetCostAndUsage) for the past 24 hours of spend by service.\n- Compare against the 7-day rolling average stored in `/data/cost_baselines.json`.\n- Flag anomalies where daily spend exceeds 130% of the rolling average for any individual service or 120% for total account spend.\n- For detected anomalies: post to #cost-alerts on Slack with a breakdown of which services spiked and by how much. If the spike exceeds 150% of baseline, trigger a manual_review event for human approval before any further action.\n\n## 5. Weekly Health Report (Monday 9:00 AM)\n- Compile a comprehensive infrastructure health report covering: total alarms fired (by severity), mean time to resolution, top 5 noisiest alarms, cost trend analysis (week-over-week), resource utilization summaries (CPU, memory, disk, network), and a list of all Jira tickets created during the week.\n- Post the report to #infrastructure-weekly as a formatted Slack message.\n- Save the report data to `/data/reports/weekly_{date}.json` for historical tracking.\n- Update baseline metrics files with the new weekly averages.\n\n## 6. State Management\n- Maintain local JSON files for: alarm tracking state, cost baselines, metric baselines, and report history.\n- On each polling cycle, read current state, process updates, and write back atomically.\n- If state files are missing or corrupted, reinitialize with sensible defaults and log a warning to Slack.",

      "errorHandling": "### AWS API Errors\n- **ThrottlingException / Rate exceeded**: Implement exponential backoff starting at 1 second, max 3 retries. If still throttled, log the failure and skip this polling cycle — the next cycle will catch up.\n- **InvalidParameterValue**: Log the exact parameter and value to Slack #infrastructure-bot-errors. Do not retry; flag for developer review.\n- **Access Denied / Credential errors**: Post a 🔴 message to #infrastructure-alerts that the monitoring agent has lost AWS access. This is itself a critical infrastructure issue. Do not retry — wait for credential rotation.\n\n### Slack API Errors\n- **channel_not_found**: Fall back to posting to a configured backup channel. Log the misconfiguration.\n- **not_authed / invalid_auth**: Log error locally, cease Slack operations, and track alerts only in local files until credentials are restored.\n- **rate_limited**: Respect the Retry-After header. Queue messages and send them after the cooldown period.\n\n### Jira API Errors\n- **404 Project not found**: Log error and skip ticket creation. Continue monitoring and Slack alerting — Jira integration is non-blocking.\n- **400 Validation error**: Log the full error response. Attempt ticket creation with minimal required fields as fallback.\n- **401/403 Auth error**: Disable Jira integration gracefully. Note in Slack alerts that auto-ticketing is temporarily unavailable.\n\n### State File Errors\n- If a state file is corrupted or unreadable, reinitialize it with empty/default values. Post a warning to Slack that historical tracking data was reset.\n- Always use atomic write patterns: write to a temp file then rename, to prevent corruption from interrupted writes.\n\n### General Resilience\n- Never let a failure in one integration (Slack, Jira, Cost Explorer) block the others. Each integration operates independently.\n- Maintain a local error log at `/data/error_log.json` for debugging. Rotate logs weekly."

    "summary": "This Infrastructure Health Monitor agent replaces four rigid CloudWatch automation pipelines with a single intelligent agent that continuously polls AWS CloudWatch alarms every 120 seconds, classifies issues by severity using baseline comparisons, posts structured health summaries to Slack with appropriate urgency routing, automatically creates and deduplicates Jira ops tickets for persistent issues, detects cost anomalies against rolling 7-day averages with human-in-the-loop escalation for major spikes, and compiles comprehensive weekly infrastructure health reports. It maintains local state for alarm tracking, cost baselines, and report history, with resilient error handling that ensures no single integration failure disrupts the overall monitoring pipeline.",
