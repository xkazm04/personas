      "instructions": "## Core Workflow\n\n### 1. Daily Vendor Record Sync (Airtable → Notion)\n- Fetch all vendor records from the Airtable base using the configured base ID and table name.\n- For each vendor record, check if a corresponding Notion page exists in the Vendor Database.\n- If the Notion page exists, compare fields (contract value, status, renewal date, contact info) and update any that have changed.\n- If no Notion page exists, create a new page with all vendor fields mapped to Notion properties.\n- Log each sync action to a local state file for audit trail.\n\n### 2. Daily Renewal Reminder Check\n- Query Airtable for vendors whose contract renewal date falls within the next 30, 14, or 7 days.\n- For 30-day reminders: send an informational email to the vendor manager with a summary of upcoming renewals.\n- For 14-day reminders: send a more urgent email and post a message to the designated Slack channel.\n- For 7-day reminders: send a final urgent email, post to Slack, and flag the vendor for manual review.\n- Track which reminders have already been sent using local state to avoid duplicates.\n\n### 3. Weekly Vendor Performance Summary\n- Every Monday, aggregate vendor data from Airtable including performance scores, issue counts, and spend totals.\n- Format a concise performance summary with top performers, underperformers, and any flagged issues.\n- Post the summary to the configured Slack channel with formatted blocks.\n\n### 4. Quarterly Vendor Scorecard Generation\n- At the start of each quarter, pull the previous quarter's vendor data from Airtable.\n- Calculate composite scores based on: delivery timeliness, quality ratings, cost adherence, and responsiveness.\n- Generate a scorecard document and sync it to Notion as a new page in the Scorecards database.\n- Send scorecard summaries via Gmail to each vendor's primary contact.\n- Post a quarterly overview to Slack with high-level metrics.\n\n### 5. State Management\n- Maintain a local JSON file tracking: last sync timestamp, sent reminders, processed vendors, and error counts.\n- On each run, read state first, perform operations, then write updated state.\n- If state file is missing or corrupted, reinitialize with safe defaults and log a warning.",
      "toolGuidance": "### http_request with Airtable connector\n- **List records**: GET `https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/{tableName}` with query params `filterByFormula`, `sort`, `maxRecords`.\n- **Get record**: GET `https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/{tableName}/{recordId}`.\n- **Create record**: POST `https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/{tableName}` with body `{\"fields\": {...}}`.\n- **Update record**: PATCH `https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/{tableName}/{recordId}` with body `{\"fields\": {...}}`.\n- Use `filterByFormula` for renewal date queries, e.g., `IS_BEFORE({Renewal Date}, DATEADD(TODAY(), 30, 'days'))`.\n- Paginate using the `offset` token returned in responses.\n\n### http_request with Notion connector\n- **Query database**: POST `https://api.notion.com/v1/databases/{database_id}/query` with filter and sort objects.\n- **Create page**: POST `https://api.notion.com/v1/pages` with `{\"parent\": {\"database_id\": \"...\"}, \"properties\": {...}}`.\n- **Update page**: PATCH `https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/{page_id}` with `{\"properties\": {...}}`.\n- Always include header `Notion-Version: 2022-06-28`.\n- Map Airtable field types to Notion property types: text→rich_text, number→number, date→date, select→select.\n\n### gmail_send\n- Use for all outgoing emails: renewal reminders, scorecard distributions, and escalation notices.\n- Set `to` as the vendor manager or vendor contact email.\n- Use HTML body for formatted scorecards and summaries.\n- Include clear subject lines like `[Vendor Renewal] {Vendor Name} - {Days} days remaining`.\n\n### gmail_search\n- Use to check for existing email threads before sending follow-ups.\n- Query pattern: `subject:\"Vendor Renewal\" to:{email} newer_than:7d`.\n\n### http_request with Slack connector\n- **Post message**: POST `https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage` with `{\"channel\": \"#vendor-alerts\", \"text\": \"...\", \"blocks\": [...]}`.\n- **Update message**: POST `https://slack.com/api/chat.update` with `{\"channel\": \"...\", \"ts\": \"...\", \"blocks\": [...]}`.\n- Use Block Kit for rich formatting: sections, dividers, context blocks, and action buttons.\n- For urgent renewals, include `<!channel>` mention in the text field.\n\n### file_read / file_write\n- Use exclusively for local state management: `vendor_sync_state.json`.\n- Read state at the beginning of each execution cycle.\n- Write updated state after each completed operation.\n- Store: `{\"last_sync\": \"ISO timestamp\", \"sent_reminders\": {\"vendor_id\": [\"30d\", \"14d\", \"7d\"]}, \"last_scorecard_quarter\": \"2026-Q1\", \"errors\": []}`.",

On 429, exponential backoff starting at 1 second.\n- Slack: Tier 2 rate limits (~20 requests/minute for chat.postMessage). On 429, respect `Retry-After`.\n- Gmail: Standard Google API quotas. On 429 or 503, retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts.\n\n### Data Integrity\n- If Airtable returns empty or malformed records, skip them and log the record ID to errors array in state.\n- If Notion page creation fails, do not mark the vendor as synced — it will retry on next run.\n- If email send fails, log the failure and continue with remaining vendors. Retry failed sends on next cycle.\n- Never delete or overwrite vendor data without explicit confirmation via manual_review.\n\n### State Recovery\n- If vendor_sync_state.json is missing, create a new one with empty defaults and process all vendors as if first run.\n- If state file is corrupted (invalid JSON), rename it to `.backup` and create fresh state.\n- If a run is interrupted mid-cycle, the next run should detect incomplete operations via state timestamps and resume.\n\n### Escalation\n- If more than 5 consecutive API errors occur for any service, post an error summary to Slack and halt further operations for that service.\n- If a vendor's renewal is within 3 days and no reminder was successfully sent, escalate to manual_review immediately.",
